# Leo's Music Shop - Flutter

Leo's Coolest Music Shop in Flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Architecture

- [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/), used for caching and global state retrieval;
- [Freezed](https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed), to reduce boilerplates and generate repetitive code;
- [Dio](https://github.com/flutterchina/dio), a robust HTTP Client;
- [Shared Preferences](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/main/packages/shared_preferences/shared_preferences), an agnostic library to work with the device persistence storage;
- [Shimmer](https://github.com/hnvn/flutter_shimmer), library to easily implement a shimmer (or loading) effect while a component is waiting for data to load.

## Motivation

At Segment there are well-known examples of mobile app examples using, for instance, React Native, but none in Flutter.
